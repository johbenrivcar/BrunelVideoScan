This shared folder is for you to submit videos to 
be scanned by Brunel's ecotrac system.

Drop your batch of videos here in a folder
containing all the video files (.mp4 or .avi)
you want to be scanned in a single run. 

After the scan there will be a single 
generated video containing only those 
parts that show movement.
